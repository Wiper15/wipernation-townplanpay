# Contributing to TownPlanPay

Thanks for wanting to contribute! This file explains how to get started, the workflow we use, and expectations for PRs.

Getting started
1. Read the project README and TEAM.md.
2. Pick an open issue from the project board or a `good-first-issue`.
3. Comment on the issue you’ll work on to claim it.

Development workflow
- Create a branch from `main` named `feature/<short-desc>` or `fix/<short-desc>`.
- Make small, focused commits. Use clear commit messages (present-tense, short).
- Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR) against `main`.
- Link the issue number in your PR description (e.g., fixes #12).
- A reviewer will request changes or merge after approval.

Branch naming
- feature/<name>
- fix/<name>
- chore/<name>

Pull Request checklist
- Title: short description of change
- Description: what changed and why
- Link any related issue(s)
- Add tests if applicable or document manual test steps
- Ensure no secrets or API keys are included
- Run linters/formatters before requesting review

Code style & tests
- Use consistent formatting. Run formatting tools if provided.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Add unit or integration tests for critical logic where reasonable.

Good first issues
- We tag easy starter tasks with `good-first-issue` and `help wanted`.
- These are designed to be completable within 1 hour.

Communication & etiquette
- Use the project’s chosen chat (Discord/Slack) for quick questions.
- Keep PRs and comments respectful and constructive.
- If you're blocked, post one message describing the blocker and relevant logs.

Maintainers
- The project maintainers will handle issue triage, PR reviews, and merges.
