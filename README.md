# 🌍 TownPlanPay — Wipernation  
### AI-Powered Conditional USDC Disbursements for Municipal Projects Worldwide  
*Global Infrastructure Payments, Starting with Nigeria — Built for Every Municipality*

> 🏗️ **"Build trust in public infrastructure — one verified milestone at a time."**  
> TownPlanPay turns municipal project milestones into instant, auditable USDC payouts — no delays, no excuses.

---

## 🧩 Summary
TownPlanPay automates **escrowed USDC payouts** to contractors when real-world milestones are verified.  
Our **AI agent (Cloudflare Workers)** evaluates submitted evidence globally, executes payments via **Circle**, and settles on the **Arc testnet**.  

Every step is verifiable — from submitted evidence to AI rationale and on-chain transaction IDs.

---

## 🌎 Why This Matters Globally

### **Municipal contractors wait months to get paid — even after completing critical infrastructure.**  
Roads, schools, and water systems stall not from lack of funds, but from **bureaucratic inefficiency** and delayed payment approvals.

TownPlanPay changes that — letting **AI validate progress** and release **escrowed USDC instantly**.

**Municipal payment delays are a worldwide crisis:**
- 🇳🇬 **Nigeria:** 6–12 month delays crippling contractors  
- 🇺🇸 **USA:** 45–90 day bureaucratic payment cycles  
- 🌍 **Global:** $1.2+ trillion lost annually to payment inefficiencies  

TownPlanPay cuts payment times from **months to minutes** while ensuring transparency with **on-chain audit trails** for every transaction.
