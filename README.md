# TownPlanPay 🌍 — Wipernation
### AI-Powered Conditional USDC Disbursements for Municipal Projects Worldwide
*Global Infrastructure Payments, Starting with Nigeria, Built for Every Municipality*

## Summary
TownPlanPay automates escrowed USDC payouts to contractors when real-world milestones are verified. Our AI agent (Cloudflare Workers) evaluates submitted evidence globally, executes payments via Circle, and settlements occur on Arc testnet. Everything is auditable: evidence, AI rationale, and transaction IDs.

## 🌎 Why This Matters Globally

**Municipal payment delays are a worldwide crisis:**
- 🇳🇬 **Nigeria:** 6-12 month delays crippling contractors
- 🇺🇸 **USA:** 45-90 day bureaucratic payment cycles  
- 🌍 **Global:** $1.2+ trillion lost annually to payment inefficiencies

TownPlanPay solves this with AI-automated approvals, reducing payment times from months to minutes while providing transparent, on-chain audit trails for every transaction.

## 📊 Global Impact Potential

### **Worldwide Problem Scale**
- **$9.5 trillion** annual global infrastructure spending [World Bank]
- **200,000+** municipalities worldwide needing solutions
- **45-360 day** payment delays across all regions
- **$1.2+ trillion** lost annually to delays and inefficiencies

### **Our Global Solution**
- **Payment Time:** 360 days → 5 minutes (99.9% faster)
- **Admin Costs:** $150 → $0.50 per transaction (99.7% cheaper)  
- **Transparency:** Opaque → 100% verifiable on-chain records
- **Scalability:** Cloud-native architecture works in any region

### **Market Adoption Roadmap**
- **Phase 1:** Nigeria launch (NDDC & state governments)
- **Phase 2:** Expand to Ghana, Kenya, South Africa
- **Phase 3:** Enter US and European municipal markets
- **Phase 4:** Global standard for public project payments

## Core MVP Features
- Create a tokenized project placeholder and fund an escrow (testnet USDC)
- Submit milestone evidence (photo or text) from anywhere in the world
- AI agent returns {decision: approve/deny, suggested_amount, explanation, confidence}
- If approved, agent triggers a Circle USDC transfer to contractor wallet on Arc testnet
- Dashboard: projects, pending milestones, transaction history, AI rationale and logs

## 🛠️ Global-Ready Tech Stack

### **Core Infrastructure**
- **AI & Serverless:** Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript) + Workers AI - 300+ global edge nodes
- **Payments:** Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets + USDC - Borderless settlements
- **Blockchain:** Arc testnet (EVM-compatible) → Multi-chain future
- **Frontend:** React + Cloudflare Pages - Global CDN deployment
- **Hosting:** Replit / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages - Worldwide access

### **Global Advantages**
- ☁️ **Cloud-Native:** Deploys to any region instantly
- 💱 **USDC:** Universal stablecoin, no currency volatility
- 🌐 **Multi-Language AI:** Understands evidence in any language
- 🏛️ **Configurable Rules:** Adapts to local government requirements

## Quick Start (Phone-Friendly)
1. **Create accounts:**
   - Circle Developer (dev console) — create test wallets and get testnet keys
   - Arc testnet — note RPC / test endpoints
   - Cloudflare — Workers & Workers AI
   - GitHub + Replit (or Codespaces) for hosting code

2. **Create repo:** `wipernation-townplanpay` and add these files (README, TEAM.md)

3. **Add secrets:** Circle API keys to Cloudflare Worker secrets or Replit secrets (do NOT put keys in frontend)

4. **Implement flow:**
   - `/suggest-milestone` (returns suggested_amount + rationale)
   - `/execute-payout` (server-side: call Circle wallet SDK/REST to transfer test USDC)

5. **Deploy globally:** Cloudflare Worker + frontend on Replit/Vercel. Test end-to-end using test wallets & test USDC.
